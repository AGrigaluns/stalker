                <p>he Stalker series (of which this is the third instalment) has always had its standout moments
                    counterbalanced by irritating lapses in translation and play testing. Call of Pripyat may not shed
                    that inconsistency entirely, but it is the best of the bunch so far.</p>
                <p>For a start, few games have made better use of lighting – including areas when only torchlight
                    punctuates the total darkness, and not just the murky, semi-gloom so often used for shock-value alone.
                    All this forces you to rely on your instincts in a way horror games have long understood but
                    first-person shooters have largely neglected. Pripyat is one of the bleakest games you'll ever come
                    across – both in the drab, fetid wastelands you traverse and the mood swings you experience when at
                    last you see a friendly face in the distance, only to discover it will rip your limbs off at the
                    first opportunity. Combine this with the underground levels swarming with mutants and the weather
                    which, when it's not raining, will periodically sear your flesh to the bone, and light relief is
                    certainly not a phrase you'll ever have cause to use.</p>

                <p>Everything about and around the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise is weird. It's developed by GSC Game World,
                    based in Ukraine, also responsible for the Cossacks series. Comprised of 3 games (eat your heart out
                    HL) that have horror, survival and RPG elements wrapped in an open world FPS. Its story encapsulates
                    everyday villains and heroes put against each other and sci-fi monsters, anomalies and artifacts,
                    while Soviet era conspiracies about mass brainwashing and the Chernobyl disaster from 1986 serve as
                    a backstage. All of it supported by one of the most advanced AIs in gaming, A-Life, with its
                    simulation of every creature you see in the game - their habits and needs, which makes the Zone a
                    truly living and breathing world.</p>

                <p>While its mechanics can be traced to other open world titles like Far Cry and Fallout, its themes are
                    a bit harder to identify. The games are set in Pripyat and its surrounding area – a time capsule of
                    Soviet era communist architecture, which are recreated to a striking degree of accuracy. Which helps
                    a lot to give these games a very strong sense of a real place.</p>

                <p>Much of the background history of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are based on Soviet Russia literature and
                    film. To be precise I'm talking about the Roadside Picnic novel, written by the Strugatsky Brothers,
                    and the movie based on it, simply titled Stalker, from Anderi Tarkovsky; both from which come the
                    artifacts, anomalies and the mysterious Zone that contains them.</p>
