        <h3>About author</h3>
        <p>Let me start this review by stating that I am a computer geek and a gamer. Thus, I was predisposed
            to like this book because it's closely tied to the premise and back story for a video game. If you
            don't like video games and zombies and mutants, you will likely have a different opinion than I did.</p>
        <p>Having provided that disclaimer...</p>

        <p>Swedish tourist Max Cotton didn't want to enter the zone (the most dangerous place on earth). But
            since he's there, he has to decide whether to risk everything in an attempt to resolve an old
            mystery. He reaches out to his friend Artur (who is still back in "the world"), by sending him a
            mysterious letter and package.</p>
        <p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Captives of the Zone is translated from either Russian or German (I think). The
            English reader may find one or two rough spots. However, these troubles are nothing compared to the
            danger filled anomalies that threaten stalkers.</p>
        <p> If you like mutants and zombies that are hungry for
            human flesh, then you'll like this cleverly illustrated and cleverly formatted book. The book is
            formatted as though Artur has scanned and posted his captured friend's notes on the Internet.</p>
        <p> The
            story is intended for afficianados of a particular video game set near the Chernobyl disaster site.
            But even if you don't play the game, you'll still enjoy the story.</p>
        <p> After reading the book, now I'm
            going to try out the game! Just remember, "the only way to leave the Zone is to find a replacement."</p>

        <p>Bloodthirsty mutants and deadly anomalies – this is the Zone of Alienation. Here, dependable friends and a
            Kalashnikov in your hands are survival necessities.</p>
        <p> But what if the secret services are after you and the
            fate of many is in your hands?! Max Cotten, a former member of the Swedish special operation forces and now
            an
            industrial designer, will have to go all out to unravel the web of intrigue and find his father, whom he
            thought dead.</p>
        <p>Will he be able to do it? Only the Zone knows…</p>
