    <h2 id="storyHeader">Story of Stalker</h2>
    <p>Based loosely on the novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and film of the same name, Stalker by
        Andrei Tarkovsky, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games take place within the Zone, an alternate history version of the
        Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. In the world of the games, experimental labs were made in the Exclusion Zone which
        allowed scientists to experiment with psychic abilities which arose following the disaster. Their
        experimentation resulted in a second disaster, causing physical and meteorological phenomena to manifest
        throughout the Zone, as well as the mutation of fauna and some humans. The Zone is littered with such
        anomalies: hazardous entities which seemingly defy physics, having various effects on any object entering them.</p>

    <p>Anomalies also often produce items known as artifacts, objects with special physical properties such as
         anti-gravity, or absorbing radiation. People known as stalkers enter the Zone in hopes of finding such items
         for personal financial gain. While a great number of stalkers work alone, various factions populate the Zone,
         each with their own philosophies and goals. For example, the Duty faction believe that the Zone is the greatest
         threat to humanity on the planet and are intent on destroying it by any means possible; by contrast, the Freedom
         faction believe the Zone should be accessible to all.</p>

    <p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine maintain a cordon around the Zone, attempting to prevent any unauthorised personnel
        from entering. Additionally, Ukrainian Spetsnaz units conduct special operations within the Zone such as surgical
        strikes on stalkers or to secure specific targets. Other hostile entities within the Zone include humans and other
        creatures mutated following the two disasters, many of them possessing aggressive psionic abilities.</p>

    <p>The protagonists of each game have their own goals separate to those of the various factions, however they are
    presented opportunities to aid in the plans of others. Generally, the ultimate objective of each game involves
    reaching the centre of the Zone, a task complicated by the various threats and hazards present therein. </p>
